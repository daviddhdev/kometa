### How to use kometa?

First of all, you need a ComicVine account and a ComicVine API key.

You can get them by creating an account on [ComicVine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/login-signup/) and then going to the API page.

Then, you need to create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```
COMIC_VINE_API_KEY=your_comicvine_api_key
```

Then you need a database. The project uses PostgreSQL.

```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

By default, the project uses a local PostgreSQL database. You can change the database URL in the .env file.

You will need a jwt secret. You can generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`

```
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Also the public url of the app.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=your_app_url
```

If you want to use push notifications, you need to generate a VAPID key. You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-push/).

Then add the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_vapid_private_key
VAPID_EMAIL=your_vapid_email
```

### Docker Setup

To run the application using Docker:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with all the required environment variables mentioned above.

3. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

4. Start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:

- Start a PostgreSQL database container
- Build and start the application container
- Create a persistent volume for the database
- Mount the `./comics` directory to store comic files
